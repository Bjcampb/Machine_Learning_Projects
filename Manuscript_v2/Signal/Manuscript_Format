Step 1:
Show how the signal data is sufficient to predict between classes
	-t_SNE
	-Dice coefficient
	-autoencoder
	Figures: Water/Fat phase difference, t-sne, autoencoder correlations, correlation matrix

Step 2:
Show how the signal data can acheive similar or better classification rates
	Figures: confusion matrix for both the peak data/ff/r2*, ROC curves

Step 3:
	Show overlays of classification overlays
